# Koodid Barcodes is an add-on for Google Docs. It adds a sidebar that can be used to insert barcodes to the document.Barcodes are useful if you need to print documents and then later quickly access some data in the printed document. You can, for example, generate a QR Code containing a link to additional information and then insert it to your document. Or you can save the document ID or other ID in the document (student ID, customer ID, etc.) as barcode and then quickly access related information.The barcodes are generated using javascript so no external service is needed to generate the barcode. You can be sure that the documents stay in Google's servers. The downside of using javascript to generate the barcodes is that you need a modern browser to use this add-on.
